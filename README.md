# **Smart Speaking Glove: Bridging the Communication Gap**

## üöÄ Project Overview  
The **Smart Speaking Glove** is an innovative assistive technology designed to empower individuals with speech and hearing impairments. By leveraging an **ESP32 microcontroller** and **Finger Resistor Sensors (FSRs)** placed on each finger, this glove translates simple gestures into spoken words. It provides a novel and intuitive way to communicate without requiring prior knowledge of sign language.  

This project integrates hardware and software seamlessly to enable real-time gesture-to-speech translation, fostering inclusivity and accessibility for people with communication challenges.

## üéØ Key Features  
- **Intuitive Alphabetical Input**: Each finger is equipped with an FSR, enabling easy gesture-based input for forming words.  
- **Real-Time Speech Conversion**: The system uses a Python-based text-to-speech (TTS) engine (**pyttsx3**) to vocalize inputs, offering immediate auditory feedback.  
- **Customizable and Scalable**: Thresholds for FSR sensitivity can be adjusted, and the system can be expanded to support more complex gestures or phrases.  
- **Accessible Design**: The glove eliminates the need for users to know sign language, focusing on simplicity and practicality.

## üí° How It Works  
1. **Input Detection**: FSRs detect finger pressure, translating specific gestures into corresponding characters (e.g., 'h', 'e', 'l', 'o').  
2. **Word Formation**: The **ESP32 microcontroller** collects inputs, forms words, and sends them via serial communication to a Python program.  
3. **Speech Output**: The Python program converts received words into speech using a TTS engine, providing real-time audio feedback.

## üîß Hardware Components  
- **ESP32 Microcontroller**: The brain of the system, handling sensor input and serial communication.  
- **Finger Resistor Sensors (FSRs)**: Mounted on each finger to detect pressure and map it to specific characters.  
- **Power Supply**: Powers the ESP32 and connected sensors.
